# Welcome!
Trailkeepers of Oregon (TKO) is a non-profit organization whose mission is to protect and enhance the Oregon hiking experience through advocacy, stewardship, outreach and education.

Our organization was born out of the Portland Hikers Forum, a community forum for hiking enthusiasts that was established in 2006, and has now grown to become the [Oregon Hikers Forum](https://www.oregonhikers.org/forum/index.php), TKOâ€™s free, online community for hikers. As the original forum grew, a user-built field guide was created and has now grown to become the [Oregon Hikers Field Guide](https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Main_Page), a free online resource hosted by TKO and maintained by dozens of volunteer authors.
